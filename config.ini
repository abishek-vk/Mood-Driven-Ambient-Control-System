# Facial Recognition System Configuration
# You can adjust these parameters to improve detection for your specific setup

[Detection Parameters]
# Face detection sensitivity (1.03-1.3, lower = more sensitive)
scale_factor = 1.05

# Minimum neighbors for face detection (3-8, higher = more strict)
min_neighbors = 5

# Minimum face size in pixels
min_face_size = 40

# Maximum face size in pixels  
max_face_size = 350

# Detection interval (frames between detections, higher = more stable)
detection_interval = 5

# Face tracking threshold (pixels, higher = less strict tracking)
tracking_threshold = 60

# Smoothing factor for face positions (0.1-0.9, higher = more smoothing)
smoothing_factor = 0.8

[Camera Settings]
# Camera resolution
frame_width = 640
frame_height = 480

# Camera FPS
fps = 30

# Camera brightness (0.0-1.0)
brightness = 0.5

# Camera contrast (0.0-1.0)
contrast = 0.5

[Display Settings]
# Show FPS counter
show_fps = true

# Show face confidence
show_confidence = true

# Show detection info panel
show_info_panel = true

[Performance Tips]
# 1. Ensure good lighting - face should be well lit
# 2. Position yourself 2-3 feet from camera
# 3. Look directly at camera for best detection
# 4. Avoid rapid movements for stable tracking
# 5. Close other camera applications
# 6. Use 's' key to slow down detection if it's too fast
# 7. Use 'f' key to speed up detection if it's too slow
# 8. Press 'r' to reset tracking if detection gets stuck
