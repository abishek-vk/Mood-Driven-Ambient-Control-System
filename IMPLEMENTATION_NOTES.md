# ✅ Two LED System - Complete Implementation

## Summary

Your Mood-Driven Ambient Control System now has a **fully implemented two-LED system** with:
- 🟢 **Green LED** for positive emotions (Pin 10)
- 🔴 **Red LED** for negative emotions (Pin 11)

---

## 🔌 Quick Wiring Guide

### Connections:

```
POSITIVE MOOD (Green LED):
Arduino Pin 10 ──[220Ω]──→ Green LED (+) ──→ GND

NEGATIVE MOOD (Red LED):
Arduino Pin 11 ──[220Ω]──→ Red LED (+) ──→ GND

GROUND REFERENCE:
Arduino GND ──→ Breadboard GND Rail (shared for both LEDs)
```

### Breadboard Layout:

```
Arduino Side:
  Pin 10 ──→ Row A (with 220Ω resistor)
  Pin 11 ──→ Row B (with 220Ω resistor)
  GND    ──→ GND Rail (blue -)

Breadboard:
  Row A:  [220Ω] → 🟢 Green LED → GND Rail
  Row B:  [220Ω] → 🔴 Red LED   → GND Rail
```

## 📊 Emotion Mapping

| Emotion | LED Response | Pin | Pattern |
|---------|--------------|-----|---------|
| 😊 Happy | 🟢 Green ON | 10 | Blink @ 2Hz |
| 😲 Surprise | 🟢 Green ON | 10 | Blink @ 2Hz |
| 😢 Sad | 🔴 Red ON | 11 | Blink @ 2Hz |
| 😠 Angry | 🔴 Red ON | 11 | Blink @ 2Hz |
| 😨 Fear | 🔴 Red ON | 11 | Blink @ 2Hz |
| 🤢 Disgust | 🔴 Red ON | 11 | Blink @ 2Hz |
| 😐 Neutral | 🟢🔴 Both | 10+11 | Alternate @ 1Hz |

## 💻 Code Implementation

### File Structure:

```
✅ src/led_control.py
   └─ LEDController class with full two-LED support
   
✅ src/emotion_detector.py
   └─ Emotion prediction with confidence scoring
   
✅ src/main.py
   └─ Real-time integration with webcam
   
✅ arduino_sketch/mood_led_control.ino
   └─ Arduino firmware handling all LED commands
```

### Python Usage Example:

```python
from src.led_control import LEDController
import serial

# Connect to Arduino
ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 9600)
led = LEDController(serial_connection=ser)

# Automatic emotion-based control
led.set_mood('happy')      # Green LED blinks
led.set_mood('sad')        # Red LED blinks
led.set_mood('neutral')    # Both blink alternately

# Manual control
led.led_positive_on()           # Green LED ON
led.led_negative_blink(freq=3)  # Red LED blink at 3Hz
led.all_leds_off()              # Both OFF
```

## 📡 Serial Commands

Commands sent from Python to Arduino via USB (9600 baud):

```
GREEN LED (Pin 10):
  PIN_10_ON          → Turn solid ON
  PIN_10_OFF         → Turn OFF
  PIN_10_BLINK_2     → Blink at 2 Hz
  PIN_10_BLINK_3     → Blink at 3 Hz

RED LED (Pin 11):
  PIN_11_ON          → Turn solid ON
  PIN_11_OFF         → Turn OFF
  PIN_11_BLINK_2     → Blink at 2 Hz
  PIN_11_BLINK_3     → Blink at 3 Hz

BOTH LEDS:
  BOTH_BLINK_ALT_1   → Alternate blink at 1 Hz
  ALL_OFF            → Turn both OFF
```

```bash
python test_arduino.py
```
Expected output: "Arduino READY" message

### Test 2: Test LED Control (No Arduino needed)
```bash
python src/led_control.py
```
Expected output: LED control simulation messages

### Test 3: Full System Test
```bash
python test_mood_led.py
```
Expected output: Real-time emotion detection with LED responses

### Test 4: Real-time with Webcam
```bash
python src/main.py
```
Expected output: Webcam feed with emotion labels and active LED control

## 🔧 Hardware Troubleshooting

### LEDs Not Lighting

**Problem:** LEDs don't respond to commands
**Solutions:**
- Check LED polarity (longer leg = positive, shorter leg = negative)
- Verify resistor connections (should be 220Ω or 330Ω)
- Test pins 10 and 11 individually with simple ON/OFF commands
- Check Arduino serial connection (correct COM port?)

### Only One LED Works

**Problem:** One LED responds but not the other
**Solutions:**
- Test pin individually: `PIN_10_ON` vs `PIN_11_ON`
- Check resistor for the non-working LED
- Verify LED isn't burned out (swap with working LED)
- Check jumper wire connections

### Constant Flickering

**Problem:** LEDs flicker unexpectedly
**Solutions:**
- Ensure stable power supply to Arduino
- Check for loose breadboard connections
- Reduce blink frequency if too fast
- Verify no interference on serial connection
