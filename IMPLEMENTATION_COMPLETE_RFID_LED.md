## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### LEDs Don't Light

**Check:**
1. LED polarity (long leg to resistor, short leg to GND)
2. Resistor value (should be 220Ω ±5%)
3. Pin connections (Pin 2 and Pin 3)
4. GND connections (secure to breadboard and Arduino)
5. LED not burned out (test with working LED)

**Fix:**
- Verify connections with multimeter
- Check voltage at each test point
- Swap components to isolate issue
- Recheck Arduino code for pin errors

### Only One LED Works

**Check:**
1. Failing LED individually with manual digitalWrite
2. Resistor for non-working LED
3. Breadboard for breaks
4. LED still has power but won't light

**Fix:**
- Test pin with simple HIGH/LOW code
- Check resistor value and continuity
- Replace potentially damaged components
- Verify Arduino pin isn't burned out

### Arduino Not Recognized

**Check:**
1. USB cable is connected
2. COM port in Device Manager
3. Arduino drivers installed
4. USB power indicator on Arduino

**Fix:**
- Try different USB port
- Install CH340 drivers (for clones)
- Check Device Manager for unknown devices
- Test with different USB cable

### Serial Communication Issues

**Check:**
1. Baud rate is 9600
2. Serial connection is open
3. No data being corrupted
4. Both Arduino and Python agree on protocol

**Fix:**
- Check serial monitor for garbage data
- Reduce baud rate if needed
- Add delay between commands
- Verify serial cable connections
