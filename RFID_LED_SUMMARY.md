## 💻 How It Works

### System Flow

```
RFID Scan
    ↓
Card Validated?
    ├─ NO → Buzzer sound, LCD shows "Denied"
    └─ YES ↓
         Emotion Analysis Starts
            ↓
         Detect Face & Emotion
            ↓
         Dominant Emotion Found
            ├─ Happy → Send "LED_GREEN_BLINK"
            ├─ Angry → Send "LED_RED_BLINK"
            └─ Other → Send "LED_OFF"
            ↓
         Arduino Executes
            ├─ Pin 2/3 HIGH/LOW alternates
            ├─ Blink interval: 500ms (1 Hz)
            └─ LED blinks on screen
            ↓
         Results Displayed
            ├─ Emotion percentage shown
            ├─ Music plays
            └─ LEDs keep blinking
```

### Serial Communication

```
Python → Arduino:
"LED_GREEN_BLINK"  (when happy detected)
"LED_RED_BLINK"    (when angry detected)
"LED_OFF"          (other emotions)

Arduino → Python:
"GREEN_LED_ACTIVE"
"RED_LED_ACTIVE"
"LEDS_OFF"
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Arduino Connection
```bash
# Check if Arduino is recognized
python -c "import serial; print(serial.tools.list_ports.comports())"
```

### Test 2: LED Control
```cpp
// Manually test in Arduino Serial Monitor:
LED_GREEN_BLINK   // Green should blink
LED_RED_BLINK     // Red should blink
LED_OFF           // Both should turn off
```

### Test 3: Full System
```bash
python src/rfid_emotion_lite.py
# Scan RFID card
# Show happy face → 🟢 Green blinks
# Show angry face → 🔴 Red blinks
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Blink Speed (Arduino)
```cpp
const int BLINK_INTERVAL = 500;  // milliseconds
// 500ms = 1 Hz (default)
// 250ms = 2 Hz (faster)
// 1000ms = 0.5 Hz (slower)
```

### Analysis Duration (Python)
```python
analysis_duration = 5  # seconds
# How long to analyze emotions after RFID scan
```

### Emotion Threshold (Python)
```python
confidence_threshold = 0.7  # 70% confidence minimum
```

| Angry | >0.60 | 🔴 Red | Blink @ 1Hz | 3 |
| Sad | >0.50 | ⚫ Off | None | - |
| Fear | >0.50 | ⚫ Off | None | - |
| Surprise | >0.70 | ⚫ Off | None | - |
| Disgust | >0.50 | ⚫ Off | None | - |

2. Swap LED with working one
3. Check resistor for non-working LED
4. Verify Arduino pin isn't damaged

### Arduino Not Recognized
1. Check USB cable
2. Verify COM port in Device Manager
3. Install CH340 drivers if needed
4. Try different USB port

### Emotion Not Detected
1. Improve lighting
2. Get closer to camera
3. Clear any face obstructions
4. Check camera is working
